# PLC's web interface

The MicroLogix 1100 has a fairly minimal web interface with mostly read-only data. Some PLCs have much more control through the web interface (e.g., firmware updates, project file updates, control data modification).

If you click through the tabs on the left, you will be prompted for a password. I recommend Googling:

```
MicroLogix 1100 default password
```

You would be surprised how many PLCs still have the default password.
